// Accepts a 'ViewBuilder' as its only 'parameter'. So, you can add 'rows' with the same syntax youâ€™ve been using with other container views such as 'HStack and VStack'
// List(scrums) { scrum in || List { ForEach(scrums, id:\.title)

//        After the scruct confirms Identifiable and add the Initilize 'id' -> I can omit that: 'id: \.id'

            // The destination presents a 'single view' in the navigation hierarchy when a user interacts with the element. Each 'row' pushes to an 'individual destination'. SwiftUI automatically adds the 'Back button' in the detail view and fills in the title of the previous screen.
        
        List {
            //            2. ForEach view passes a scrum into its closure, but the DetailView initializer expects a binding to a scrum.

//        Adding the NavigationView displays navigation elements, like title and bar buttons, on the canvas

}


// Add a ForEach view. Pass the scrums array and a key path to the title property to the initializer.
//        ForEach needs a way to 'identify individual items' in the collection.
//        For now, because all of the scrums in the test data have different names, you can use the title property to identify each item.
